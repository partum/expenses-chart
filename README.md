## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- JSON
- Fetch API


### What I learned

This is the first time I've used JSON and Fetch API. It was easier than I thought and I will make sure to practice it again in the future.
I think I should have planned the bar chart section better. I wrote this ad-hoc for each sub-feature of the bars but I had to rewrite it as I realized things weren't working out.

### Continued development

I need to understand Fetch API better.
I noticed that if the amount of money spent is high (4+ figures) then the layout is negatively impacted. If this were to be used in real life, then I would have to make sure it works for edge cases.
